** EDA on James Bond Movie Analysis using Python and Tableau**

üìã **Overview**
    
As a lover of James Bond Movies, I decided to do a fun project on all the 27 movies. This project explores the financial and critical performance of James Bond movies over time. Using data analysis and visualization techniques, the project evaluates key metrics such as Return on Investment (ROI), budget, box office performance, and audience ratings. The analysis also examines trends by Bond actors and investigates how these metrics have evolved through the franchise's history. I also use Tableau to analysis the movies too, see the link below.

üöÄ **Project Highlights**

  * Feature Importance Analysis: Evaluated which factors most influence ROI, highlighting the importance of budget, release year, and audience ratings.
    
  * Temporal Trends: Investigated budget, box office, and ROI trends to understand how the James Bond franchise's financial dynamics have changed over time.
    
  * Bond Actor Impact: Analyzed ROI by Bond actors, revealing Sean Connery and Roger Moore as the highest contributors to financial success.
    
  * Audience Reception: Studied the evolution of IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes audience ratings to evaluate the franchise's popularity over time.
    
üìä **Key Findings**

1. ROI Trends:

  * Sean Connery leads with an average ROI of 180.39, followed by Roger Moore at 63.29.
    
  * Modern Bond films (Daniel Craig era) show lower ROI due to rising production costs, despite high box office revenues.
    
2. Popularity Insights:

  * Audience ratings (IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes) indicate fluctuating popularity, with peaks during the Connery and Craig eras.
    
3. Feature Importance:

  * Budget contributes 39% to predicting ROI, followed by the release year (24%) and film length (11%).

4. Temporal Trends:

  * The average ROI has declined over time due to increased production budgets and a competitive film landscape.
